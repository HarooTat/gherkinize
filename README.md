# Gherkinize

A command line tool that will help us to write better Gherkin scenarios.


## Purpose

The purpose of this project is mainly helping people to write **Gherkin scenarios** correctly.


## Getting Started


### Installing

```
brew install gherkinize
```

Once the software is installed we can make use of it.

**gherkinize --help / gherkinize -h**

**gherkinize --input [scenarios_dir] --config [gherkin-rules.toml] validate**

It validates our scenarios. Both arguments **input** and **config** are required.

- input: it must point to a directory that contains the scenarios to be validated. (So far it only supports directories path)
- config:  it is a **toml** configuration file path that must look like below. You can download [this](https://github.com/wesovilabs/gherkinize/blob/master/config/gherkin-rules.toml)


## Gherkin rules configuration file

![alt text](https://github.com/wesovilabs/gherkinize/blob/master/doc/config.png "Gherkin Rules Validator")

**max_steps_per_scenario**: It determines the maximum number of steps per scenario. Many steps could make our scenarios not easy-to-read

**max_len_step**: Max len for steps. Steps with long text are usually hard to understand.

**empty_feature**: Set false if you don't want to allow empty features without scenarios.

**empty_scenario**: Set false if you don't want to allow empty scenarios without steps.

**strict**: This checks the below conditions:

* The first step must be GIVEN

* The keyword GIVEN can be only used once.

* WHEN can only be used after GIVEN statements

* THEN statement can only be used after WHEN statements
